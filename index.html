                    <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus 
                        to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the n***** talks. 
                        Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, 
                        know what I'm sayin'? </p>
                        
                    <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it 
                        killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb 
                        out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived 
                        the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd 
                        say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold 
                        a candle to man. </p>
                        
                    <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my 
                        name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting 
                        outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's 
                        what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping 
                        for an infant named Jeb. </p>
