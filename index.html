                <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
                    glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the n***** talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
                    my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>
                
                <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
                    and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
                    turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
                    oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
                    lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>
                
                <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?
                    Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that
                    shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a
                    toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>
